# Python Analysis Scripts (Jupyter Notebooks)

This folder contains the step-by-step analytical workflow for this project, carried out in Python using Jupyter notebooks.  
The notebooks show the complete data preparation and transformation process, from initial wrangling to visualization.

## Contents Overview

| Notebook Name | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **4.4 Data Wrangling and Subsetting.ipynb** | Initial selection and filtering of raw data. |
| **4.5 DATA Checks New .ipynb** / **4.5 DataConsitencyChecks.ipynb** | Identifying missing values, duplicates, and validating data quality. |
| **4.6 Part 1 & Part 2 (Merge Dataframes)** | Merging datasets and combining customer, order, and product information. |
| **4.7 Deriving New Variables.ipynb** | Creating new calculated fields for analysis. |
| **4.8 Grouping Data & Aggregating Variables.ipynb** | Summarizing and aggregating data to reveal trends and patterns. |
| **4.9 Intro to Data Visualization with Python.ipynb** | Visual exploration of data using charts and plots. |
| **4.9 Part1_with_new_customer_data.ipynb / 4.9 Part2.ipynb** | Final analysis steps and preparation of output used for reporting. |
| **Instacard_Notebook_.ipynb** | Consolidated notebook with full workflow. |

## How to Run

1. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
Open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab / Notebook:

bash
Code kopieren
jupyter lab
Run cells in order from top to bottom.

Notes
These are working analytical files â€” they show the data exploration and decision-making process.

The final visuals and client-ready outputs are stored separately in:

../Visualizations/

../Sent_to_Client/
