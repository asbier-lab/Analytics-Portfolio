# Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains my **Achievement 3 (SQL)** and **Achievement 4 (Python)** projects from the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program. Together, they demonstrate my ability to perform data analysis across different tools and environments — from querying relational databases with SQL to conducting exploratory and statistical analysis in Python.  

Each project reflects end-to-end analytical thinking: understanding business needs, transforming and analyzing data, and communicating insights through clear storytelling and visualizations.

## Achievement 3: Rockbuster Stealth SQL Project

### Introduction
**Rockbuster Stealth LLC** is a global movie rental company transitioning from physical stores to an online streaming service. The management team wanted to use data-driven insights to guide their launch strategy and competitive positioning.  

As a data analyst in the **Business Intelligence (BI)** department, my role was to:
- Load Rockbuster’s data into a **PostgreSQL database**
- Query the data to answer business questions
- Present insights visually for management

This project demonstrates my ability to explore relational databases, write complex SQL queries, and produce insights that inform strategic decisions.

### Key Questions & Objectives
The management board asked:
- Which movies contributed the most or least to revenue?
- What was the average rental duration for all films?
- Which countries are Rockbuster’s customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value located?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

### Tools & Skills
- **Tools:** PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Tableau, Excel  
- **Skills:** Data extraction, joins, aggregations, subqueries, data cleaning, data storytelling, visualization

### Deliverables
- SQL queries answering key business questions
- Summary reports visualized in Tableau
- A presentation of findings for management

### Files
- `query_revenue.sql` – Revenue contribution by film  
- `query_rental_duration.sql` – Average rental duration  
- `query_customers_by_country.sql` – Customer distribution by country  
- `query_high_value_customers.sql` – Lifetime value segmentation  
- `query_sales_by_region.sql` – Regional sales analysis

## Achievement 4: Instacart Python Project

### Introduction
**Instacart** is an online grocery delivery service aiming to improve its marketing strategy through customer segmentation. The company wanted to better understand its customers’ purchasing behaviors, spending patterns, and loyalty levels.

My task was to conduct an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Python to uncover patterns and inform targeted marketing campaigns. The analysis focused on identifying meaningful customer segments and behavioral trends.

### Key Questions & Objectives
Stakeholders wanted to answer:
- What are the busiest days and hours of the week for orders?
- At what times do customers spend the most money?
- Which departments or product types are most popular?
- How do customer demographics (age, family status, income) affect order behavior?
- How does brand loyalty vary across customers?
- What actionable customer segments can be defined for marketing?

### Tools & Skills
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Python (Anaconda), Excel  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, os, scipy  
- **Skills:** Data wrangling, data cleaning, merging, conditional logic, aggregation, visualization, customer segmentation, report automation

### Deliverables
- Cleaned and merged datasets with 100% merge match verification  
- Derived metrics and segmentation flags (e.g., loyalty, spending categories)  
- Visualizations (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, line charts)  
- Final report summarizing findings and recommendations for stakeholders
