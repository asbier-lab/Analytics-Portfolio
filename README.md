## Introduction
Instacart is an online grocery delivery service seeking insights to improve marketing strategies.  
I analyzed customer purchasing behaviors to identify patterns, loyalty trends, and actionable segments.

## Key Questions & Objectives
Stakeholders wanted to answer:
- What are the busiest days and hours of the week for orders?
- At what times do customers spend the most money?
- Which departments or product types are most popular?
- How do customer demographics (age, family status, income) affect order behavior?
- How does brand loyalty vary across customers?
- What actionable customer segments can be defined for marketing?

## Tools & Skills
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Python (Anaconda), Excel  
**Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy  
**Skills:** Data wrangling, data cleaning, merging, conditional logic, aggregation, visualization, customer segmentation, report automation

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and merged datasets with 100% merge match verification  
- Derived metrics and segmentation flags (e.g., loyalty, spending categories)  
- Visualizations (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, line charts)  
- Final report summarizing findings and recommendations for stakeholders
